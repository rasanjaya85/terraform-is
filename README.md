# Installation

### Prerequisites

* Install and set up [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) (>= v1.4.0 )
* Install and set up [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (>= v0.12.00 )


### Instructions:

1. Download the WSO2  Identity Server terraform resource.

2. Build the Identity Server custom image. 

   **Note:**  If you have an Azure subscription, update user variables in `centos-base.json`  file using your subscription credentials. The WSO2 Identity Server  5.10.0 distribution needs to download into the  `ansible-apim/files/packs` directory. If you do not have a WSO2 subscription account, you can sign up for a free trial [here](https://wso2.com/free-trial-subscription). 

```bash
$ packer build centos-base.json 
```

3. Update the build baseimage in terraform `variables.tf` file and `terraform.tfvars` maintains the Azure subscription credentials. 


   ```bash
     $ terraform apply  
   ```

   **Note:**  Add the host entry in  `/etc/hosts` file with `<PUBLIC-IP> is.wso2test.com`  to access the WSO2 Identity Server console. 
 
4. Try navigating to the following consoles from your favorite browser.
